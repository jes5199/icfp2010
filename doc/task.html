Each car has subtly                        different specifications, so some fuels may suit its                        engine, and others may not. Given a car and a fuel, it                        is easy to check whether the fuel fits the car, and that                        is what the contest server will be doing. Given only the                        car, it may not be easy to design a fuel that fits. This                        will be part of your task. Cars are open-sourced (anyone                        can read their specification), but fuels are closed-sourced                        (so you cannot copy others' fuels).</p>                        <p>During the contest, you will execute two types of                        actions:</p>                        <ul>                            <li>compute and upload fuel for a car;</li>                            <li>upload a new car, with matching fuel.</li>                        </ul>                        <p>This is your source of income, and we will compute                        and display your score (in short intervals).</p>                        <p>Each car on the market is a constant source of                        profit. For each car, the profit is shared among all                        manufacturers of fuels for that car. This includes the                        creator of the car.

Both pipes suck in air, which is freely                        available, and is in fact a mixture of several                        ingredients.</p>                        <p>In each section, a chemical reaction combines                        ingredients coming from the neighboring section on the                        left, and of fuel that is fed directly to the section                        from a fuel tank, and the output ingredients are fed to                        the next section on the right.

The circuit's input stream appears at the output                        of the external gate, and the circuit's output stream is                        fed to the external gate's input.</p>                        <p>So, the factory is producing a stream that describes                        fuel. The size of the factory is the number of its                        gates, and smaller factories are more efficient.
